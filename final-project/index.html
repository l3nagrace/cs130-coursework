            <h2>are you offended?</h2>
            <p>Sorry, we didn't mean to! we were just trying to be witty for our computer science project :,)
            <h2>that being said, what is our computer science project?</h2>
            <p>think of it like a kind of blog where we present what we have been watching, reading, and listening to and review them in an aesthetic, personalized, easy-to-navigate way.
                In other words, this is less like a database of reviews and pop culture infomation sites such as IMDB or Rotten Tomato and more of a personal space where we can share
                our thoughts in a low-stakes, judgement free zone just for us!</p>
