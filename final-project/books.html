                        <h2>Emily Henry |  ðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š</h2>
                        <p>Think Love, Rosie meets One Day in this perfect lighthearted summer beachside read! Alternating between past and present, People we Meet on Vacation tells of ex-best friends Alex and Poppyâ€™s annual summer vacations and tries to figure out - what went wrong in the middle to estrange the once inseparable pair? A beautiful, just *chefs kiss* tale about soulmates and poor timing, and one that tore my heart apart but put it back together in the best way possible. For PWMOV alone, Emily Henry has stolen one of the spots in my heart in terms of favorite authors, and Iâ€™m not mad about it.

                        <p>This book has me utterly convinced #booktok is a scam. <br>
                            Dark thriller fantasies is one of my favorite genres and I've been really fascinated by Disassociative Identity Disorder ever since learning about it a few years ago, but this bookâ€™s representation of it is poor and frankly demeaning. I got progressively more uncomfortable as the plot went on, and finished it being like â€˜what did I just readâ€™ <br>

                            Everything is in chunks and all over the place, the plot is predictable from the get-go, and some scenes are really, really disturbing and just left as is without any follow-up. The chemistry between the main characters felt forced and awkward, the setting of the story didnâ€™t make any sense.<br>
                            
                            TL;DR: this book is just an empty plot tangled beneath a web of beautiful language and imagery. And to think that it has a 4.5 star rating on GoodReads!! I wish people would stop giving ratings BEFORE reading a book to build up hype, it really messes it up for other people who are looking for good book recs.

                        <p>*ULTIMATE CHEFâ€™S KISS* <br>
                            Out of the blue, billionaire Tobias Hawthorne bypasses his two daughters and four grandsons, leaves orphaned Avery Grambs, who has no idea who Hawthorne even is, his entire fortune. Thereâ€™s just one catch: in order to receive the inheritance, Avery has to move into Hawthorne House, where sheâ€™s instantly swept away into an entanglement of lies, deception, wealth and riddles. 
                            Barnesâ€™ writing is impeccable and takes your mind on such an incredible rollercoaster ride. 
                            Please go read this already.
